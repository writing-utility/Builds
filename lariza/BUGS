Links sometimes do not open in a new tab
========================================

We select for "mouse-target-changed" events: When the pointer is being
moved, WebKit tells us if it's now being positioned over a link or not.

However, when a new link pops into existence right below the mouse
pointer (without the pointer being moved), we don't get this event. When
the user now issues a middle-click, we open the link in the same tab.
This is wrong.

Ideally, we could access a hit test result while processing the click
event, but that doesn't appear to be possible?

This bug is also present in suckless surf and GNOME Epiphany.
