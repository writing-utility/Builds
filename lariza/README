Background information
----------------------

 What lariza is and what it's not

  lariza does what I need. It won't do other things. I'm open for pull
  requests but please don't be upset if I turn them down -- which might
  happen if it's a feature that I simply don't need. That being said,
  you should have a look at the PATCHES file. :-)

  lariza does not compete with powerful browsers like dwb or luakit, nor
  with monstrous applications like Firefox or Chromium. lariza won't
  have persistent storage, nor a plugin system, nor cloud sync, nor
  bookmarks.


 About the name

  "lariza" stems from a german sentence:

      Alle anderen waren mir zu anstrengend.
       l   a         r    i  z  a

  That phrase basically means: "It was too tiresome to deal with any
  other browser." I couldn't find a simple browser that does just what I
  need. Most of them are utterly bloated, others lack essential
  functions. Thus, I was forced to write scripts and tools and stuff to
  deal with these issues. That is what was tiresome. I don't want to
  work around bugs or nonsensical behavior anymore.

  So, I wrote my own browser^W WebKit GUI. WebKit does all the dirty
  work.
